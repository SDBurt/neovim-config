# Neovim Plugin Usage Guide

This document covers all the plugins installed in this Neovim configuration and how to use them effectively.

## üéØ Harpoon - Quick File Navigation
**The most important productivity plugin**

### Keybindings:
```
<leader>a     - Add current file to harpoon list
<C-e>         - Toggle harpoon quick menu
<C-h/j/k/l>   - Jump to files 1/2/3/4
<C-S-P/N>     - Previous/next harpoon file
```

### Workflow:
1. Open your main project files
2. Press `<leader>a` in each file to add them to harpoon
3. Use `<C-h/j/k/l>` to instantly jump between your marked files
4. Use `<C-e>` to see/manage your harpoon list

This replaces traditional buffer/tab switching for your core files.

## ‚ö° Flash - Enhanced Motion
**Better than default f/t motions**

### Keybindings:
```
s             - Flash jump (type 2 chars, then label)
S             - Flash treesitter (jump to code structures)
r             - Remote flash (in operator mode)
<c-s>         - Toggle flash in search
```

### How Flash Labels Work:
1. Press `s`
2. Type 2 characters (e.g., "th" to find "the", "this", "throw")
3. Flash highlights all matches with single-letter labels (a, b, c, etc.)
4. Press the label letter to jump to that location

**Example**: 
- Press `s`
- Type `fu` (to find "function")
- See labels: `a` at first "function", `b` at second "function"
- Press `a` to jump to first match

This is much faster than using `/` to search and then navigating matches.

## üîß Nvim-Surround - Text Objects
**Add/change/delete surrounding characters**

### Keybindings:
```
ys<motion><char>  - Add surround (ys2w" = surround 2 words with quotes)
yss<char>         - Surround entire line
cs<old><new>      - Change surround (cs"' = change " to ')
ds<char>          - Delete surround (ds" = remove quotes)
S<char>           - Surround selection (in visual mode)
```

### Examples:
- `ysiw"` - Surround current word with quotes: `word` ‚Üí `"word"`
- `cs"'` - Change double quotes to single: `"hello"` ‚Üí `'hello'`
- `ds(` - Delete parentheses: `(hello)` ‚Üí `hello`
- `yss}` - Surround entire line with braces

## üîó Nvim-Autopairs
**Auto-close brackets/quotes**

Works automatically when typing:
- Type `(` ‚Üí automatically adds `)`
- Type `"` ‚Üí automatically adds closing `"`
- Integrates with completion for smart behavior

## üìä Lualine - Status Line
**Shows current mode prominently**

### Features:
- **Mode indicator** with colors (INSERT/NORMAL/VISUAL/COMMAND)

<leader>xq    - Quickfix list
<leader>xl    - Location list
gR            - LSP references (better than default)

## üí° Pro Tips & Workflows

### Essential Daily Workflow:
1. **Start with Harpoon** - Add your main files (`<leader>a`), jump with `<C-h/j/k/l>`
2. **Use Flash for navigation** - `s` + 2 chars + label (faster than searching)
3. **Trouble for diagnostics** - `<leader>xx` to see all project errors
4. **Which-key for discovery** - Press `<leader>` and explore

### File Management:
- **Quick edits**: Use Oil (`-`) to edit directories like buffers
- **Project overview**: Use nvim-tree (`<leader>e`) for visual navigation
- **Terminal operations**: `<C-\>` for quick commands, `<leader>gg` for git

### Code Editing:
- **Surround operations**: Learn `ys`, `cs`, `ds` for quick text manipulation
- **Smart commenting**: `gcc` for lines, `gc` in visual mode
- **Better text objects**: `daf` (delete function), `cic` (change class)

### Debugging:
- Set breakpoints (`<space>b`), start with `<F1>`
- Use `<leader>dd` to toggle debug UI
- Step through with F2/F3/F4

### Most Important to Learn First:
1. **Harpoon** - Transform file navigation
2. **Flash** - Better movement
3. **Surround** - Text manipulation
4. **Which-key** - Discover features
5. **Trouble** - Better error handling

This configuration transforms Neovim into a modern, efficient development environment. Start with the essential workflow and gradually explore more features as needed.
